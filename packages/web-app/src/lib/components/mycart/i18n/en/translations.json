Use the checkboxes to select the resources you want to include, then click the <span class='font-semibold'>View on map</span> button at the bottom of the table. If a resource doesn’t have an available map layer, it can’t be selected — but you can still view its details by clicking the row in the table to navigate to the corresponding record page. To remove a resource, click the garbage can icon next to its name, or use the <span class='font-semibold'>Remove all</span> button to clear the list.",
